#### 3D Point Cloud Analysis for BIM Automation
   ##### Overview
This repository contains research and implementation of a deep learning-based approach for the semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds. The primary objective is to classify point cloud data captured from industrial environments into Building Information Modeling (BIM) objects, automating the generation of BIM models in Autodesk Revit.

Automating BIM generation from raw 3D point cloud data marks a significant advancement in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industries. This approach reduces manual labor and enhances the accuracy of BIM models.
